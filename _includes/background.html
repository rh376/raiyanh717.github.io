      I'm currently an Undergraduate student at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.upstatement.com/" target="_blank">NJIT</a> working on perfecting my coding capabilities while learning new languages and skills. I am pursuing a degree in
      <a class="underline-link" href="http://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">Information Technology</a> while minoring in
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://us.mullenlowe.com/" target="_blank">Computer Science.</a>,
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://starry.com/" target="_blank">Starry</a>, and
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/music/" target="_blank">Apple Music</a>.

    <p>
      As an undergraduate, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably snowboarding, cruising around on my penny board,
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
